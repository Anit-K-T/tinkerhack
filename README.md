Problem Statement - People find it difficult to move from one store to another in search of a product. If its not avilable in one store they will go in search of another store. What if a website is made available to them so that everyone can identify in which store the product is available ?




Solution - Yes, we are here with a solution to this problem. All the people in a particular area can access the website known as 'Know Ur Shop'. If they search for an element the number of stock available and the store where this product is avilable will be shoen . So that the customer need not go to each and every store to find a product. This is time efficient as well as very helpful to others.
